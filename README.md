# Tick-Induced Mammalian Meat Allergy in Australia

Interactive web application for exploring national surveillance data on alpha-gal syndrome (mammalian meat allergy) in Australia, 2014-2024.

## About

This repository contains the code and public data for an interactive web application that provides access to epidemiological data on tick-induced mammalian meat allergy (alpha-gal syndrome, AGS) in Australia. The application accompanies the research manuscript:

**"Tick-Induced Mammalian Meat Allergy in Australia: National Prevalence and Geographic Distribution from Laboratory Surveillance, 2014-2024"**

[Link to published manuscript](https://doi.org/10.XXXX/XXXXXX)

## Features

The interactive application includes:

- **Interactive Map** - Explore the geographic distribution of suspected AGS cases across Australian SA3 regions, with overlay of *Ixodes holocyclus* tick distribution
- **Interactive Figures** - All 7 manuscript figures with zoom, pan, and data exploration capabilities:
  - Figure 1: Age and sex distribution
  - Figure 2: Risk ratios by age and sex
  - Figure 3: Annual testing trends
  - Figure 4: Testing expansion analysis
  - Figure 5: Geographic concentration
  - Figure 6: Interactive map (main feature)
  - Figure 7: Longitudinal antibody dynamics
- **Data Tables** - Sortable, searchable tables with regional statistics
- **Responsive Design** - Light/dark theme support with mobile compatibility
